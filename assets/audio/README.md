# Sample Audio Files for Notification Tones

This directory contains sample audio files for testing the notification tone functionality in the app.

## Required Audio Files

The following audio files are referenced in the sample data:

- `chime.mp3` - A classic chime sound
- `bell.mp3` - A classic bell sound
- `digital.mp3` - A modern digital notification sound
- `melody.mp3` - A melodic notification sound
- `nature.mp3` - An ambient nature sound
- `ocean.mp3` - An ambient ocean sound

## How to Use

1. Add your own MP3 files with the names listed above to this directory
2. In the app, toggle the switch in the notification tone screen to use sample data
3. The app will use these local audio files instead of fetching from the backend

## Note

These are sample files for testing purposes only. In a production environment, you would typically fetch notification tones from a server.
